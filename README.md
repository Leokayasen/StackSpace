# StackSpace

### What is StackSpace?
Ever heard of Discord? StackSpace aims to be a developer-focused equivalent to discord.

With an intention to have chat, voice and a workspace system, we want to create an environment where developers of all ranges can come together to talk and share in a central place.

Sure you could just go to a discord server and do the same, but there's so many distractions!
With StackSpace, you have both regular chats, and sharable workspaces with full IDE features.

### Can I contribute?
As of Feb 21, this project is only maintained and developed by myself.\
I have, however, decided to keep this project open source as stated below.

This means anyone can contribute and help expand this project.

You are also welcome to "sponsor" the project through the Patreon linked to the repository.
